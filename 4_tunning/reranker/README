There are five python programs here (-h for usage):

-rerank: reads N-best lists and for each one chooses the English sentence
 with the highest score according the dot product of its feature values
 and a weight vector.

-learn: reads N-best lists and, using human translations of the same 
 sentences as supervision, learns a weight vector for the features appearing
 in the N-best list.

-oracle: reads N-best lists and a human reference translation, and computes
 an approximation to the best possible BLEU score that can be obtained from
 the N-best list.

-grade: computes the BLEU score of the translations.

-check: ensures that an output file is in the correct format.

There is also a module bleu.py which contains utility functions used
by several of the programs

The data directory contains several files derived from a French-English
newswire translation task. 

-train.fr: Training data consisting of French news text 
-train.en: Human translations of the French training data
-train.nbest: N-best machine translations of the French training data
-test.fr: 500 sentences of French test data
-test.en: Human translations of the first 250 sentences of the French test
-test.nbest: N-best machine translations of the French test data

In a press conference held in the wake of a conference about the future of peace in the Middle East , Sha ' ath said , " If Israel will not agree to solve outstanding problems within the framework of negotiations concerning the transitional period , then there is no solution other than to move discussions on to the final status of the Palestinian territories . "
Sh ' ath , who is the closest advisor to the Palestinian Authority 's leader , Yasser Arafat , said , " This alternative proposal must be given serious consideration because the paralysis in the peace process that we are seeing at the moment is extremely costly . "

Sha ' ath , the principal Palestinian negotiator in the peace talks with Israel , said that discussions about the interim period for Palestinian territories could be conducted in parallel with discussions about their final status .
He pointed out that the declaration of principles , signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington in September  1993  , states that negotiations regarding the final status of the Palestinian territories should begin , at the latest , in late  1996  .
Sha ' ath emphasized that " Israel instigated a crisis when it laid down conditions " regarding the resumption of discussions concerning widening the scope of Palestinian self - rule .
He added that a second solution would be for Israel to proceed toward the " second phase of self - rule , " which would involve the Israeli army withdrawing from Palestinian areas in the Occupied West Bank and parliamentary elections being conducted for self - rule .
He added that this solution requires " increased mutual responsibility , especially with regard to security issues .
We are also waiting for Israel to comply with the timetable it agreed to . "
Sha ' ath stressed that " Israel 's current position , its conditions and the paralysis of the process has placed me in a quandary ( â¦ ) . The time has come to seriously reassess all these questions . "

Judge Michael Mocasey said , " I take as seriously as you do " the effect the bombing might have on the course of justice " but we cannot assess that at the present moment . "
